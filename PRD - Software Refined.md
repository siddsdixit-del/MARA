## MARA Hybrid Compute Platform (HCP)

**Document Version**: 2.0
**Date**: October 2025
**Product Owner**: MARA Digital Infrastructure Division
**Target Launch**: Q2 2025 (MVP), Q4 2025 (Full Platform)

## 1. Executive Summary

The MARA Hybrid Compute Platform (HCP) is a cloud-native orchestration system that dynamically allocates computational resources between Bitcoin mining and AI inference workloads based on real-time economic signals. The platform will manage 50,000+ GPUs and 250,000+ ASICs across multiple global data centers, optimizing for revenue, energy efficiency, and grid stability.

**The Exaion acquisition significantly accelerates MARA's entry into the AI market.** Exaion brings existing AI infrastructure and expertise, including 1,250 operational GPUs across 4 data centers, partnerships with NVIDIA and Deloitte, and a GDPR-compliant, Tier-4 data center. This acquisition allows MARA to leverage existing AI infrastructure and expertise, reducing time-to-market and capital expenditure. The synergies between MARA's Bitcoin mining operations and Exaion's AI capabilities create a unique "digital energy infrastructure" company.

**Key Differentiators and Competitive Advantages:**

*   **First-mover advantage** in the converged AI-crypto infrastructure market.
*   **Capital efficiency and reduced time-to-market** resulting from the Exaion acquisition.
*   **Unique "digital energy infrastructure" narrative** for investors.

### Key Objectives

*   Enable sub-second workload switching between Bitcoin mining and AI inference
*   Maximize revenue through real-time economic optimization (Target: $750M-$1.5B additional annual revenue)
*   Provide enterprise-grade API for AI workload submission
*   Ensure 99.99% uptime for critical workloads
*   Achieve SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance
*   Implement Edge Computing for local processing and rapid decision-making
*   Implement Dynamic Power Management for optimizing power consumption
